## Why I chose Astronomy

I have always been interested in space.
Each planet and moon in our own Solar system is unique with many interesting aspects. Beyond our suns system are even more stars many with worlds which are just as unique as our own. In an ever expanding universe littered with countless galaxies, each filled with billions of stars, we can't be the only life that exists.

## Prompts used for the site

### please write a synopsis of each planet in our Solar system.

Mercury:
Characteristics: The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is a small, rocky planet with extreme temperature variations between its scorching day and freezing night.
Features: It has a thin atmosphere, and its surface is marked by impact craters, cliffs, and large plains.

Venus:
Characteristics: Venus is similar in size and composition to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.
Features: Surface features include volcanic plains, highland regions, and mountains. It rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most other planets.

Earth:
Characteristics: The only known planet to support life, Earth has a diverse range of ecosystems, oceans, and a protective atmosphere.
Features: Unique features include continents, oceans, and a variety of climates. It is also home to a vast array of living organisms.

Mars:
Characteristics: Often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich soil, Mars is a cold, desert-like planet with a thin atmosphere.
Features: It has the tallest volcano (Olympus Mons) and the longest canyon (Valles Marineris) in the solar system. Evidence suggests that liquid water existed on its surface in the past.

Jupiter:
Characteristics: The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.
Features: It has a strong magnetic field and a system of rings. The Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries on its surface.

Saturn:
Characteristics: Saturn is another gas giant known for its stunning ring system, which is composed of ice particles and rocky debris.
Features: Apart from its prominent rings, Saturn has many moons, and its appearance is characterized by cloud bands in its atmosphere.

Uranus:
Characteristics: Uranus is an ice giant with a blue-green hue, and it rotates on its side, likely due to a collision early in its history.
Features: It has a faint ring system and a set of moons, the most notable being Miranda with its varied and unique surface features.

Neptune:
Characteristics: Neptune is another ice giant, known for its deep blue color and strong winds in its atmosphere.
Features: It has a dark spot reminiscent of Jupiter's Great Red Spot and a set of rings. Neptune also has a moon, Triton, which is unique for its retrograde orbit.

### What is an Exoplanet and give a synopsis of 5 of the more interesting ones

An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system. Since the first confirmed detection in the 1990s, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered using various methods, including the transit method (detecting a planet as it passes in front of its host star, causing a temporary dimming), radial velocity method (measuring the star's wobble caused by the planet's gravitational pull), and direct imaging.

Here are synopses of five interesting exoplanets:

Kepler-186f:
Characteristics: Located about 500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, Kepler-186f is notable as the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of its star. This means it could have conditions suitable for liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it.

TRAPPIST-1e:
Characteristics: Part of the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is just 40 light-years away, TRAPPIST-1e is one of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultracool dwarf star. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone. The potential for liquid water and the proximity of the system make it a fascinating target for further study.
HD 209458 b (Osiris):

Characteristics: This exoplanet, located about 150 light-years away, gained attention for being one of the first planets to have its atmosphere directly detected. Osiris is a hot Jupiter, orbiting very close to its host star. Its atmosphere contains elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.

WASP-121b:
Characteristics: WASP-121b is an exoplanet about 880 light-years away, known for its extreme conditions. It is a "hot Jupiter" with a surface temperature that reaches over 4,000 degrees Celsius (7,232 degrees Fahrenheit). The intense heat causes heavy metals like iron and magnesium to exist in a gaseous state in its atmosphere.

OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb:
Characteristics: This exoplanet, discovered through gravitational microlensing, is located about 13,000 light-years away. It is intriguing because it is a gas giant roughly four times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting a star at an enormous distance. Its discovery challenges conventional theories about where and how gas giants form.

These exoplanets represent a small fraction of the diverse and fascinating worlds discovered beyond our solar system, each offering unique insights into the variety of planetary systems in our galaxy.

### Describe NASA, its mission, and 5 interesting projects it is currently working on

NASA is the United States government agency responsible for the nation's civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. Established in 1958, its mission is to explore space, conduct scientific research, and develop technologies that advance our understanding of the universe and benefit life on Earth. NASA has been a key player in numerous historic space exploration missions, including the Apollo moon landings, the Space Shuttle program, and the Mars rover missions.

Artemis Program:

Objective: Returning humans to the Moon, including the first woman and the next man, by the mid-2020s.
Key Features: Artemis includes the Space Launch System (SLS), the Orion spacecraft, and the Gateway, a lunar orbiting outpost. The program aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon to prepare for future crewed missions to Mars.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):

Objective: To be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.
Key Features: JWST is a powerful space telescope set to launch to the second Lagrange point (L2) to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths. It will study the formation of the first galaxies, the atmospheres of exoplanets, and many other celestial phenomena.

Mars Sample Return (MSR) Mission:

Objective: To collect samples from the surface of Mars and return them to Earth for detailed analysis.
Key Features: A collaborative effort with the European Space Agency (ESA), MSR aims to collect Martian soil and rock samples using the Perseverance rover and a future ESA rover. These samples will provide insights into the planet's geology, climate, and potential past life.

Europa Clipper:

Objective: To explore Jupiter's moon Europa, believed to have a subsurface ocean, for signs of life and habitability.
Key Features: The spacecraft will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Europa's surface and subsurface, assessing its ice shell and searching for plumes of water vapor. The mission aims to understand the moon's potential for hosting life.

Dragonfly Mission to Titan:

Objective: To study prebiotic chemistry and extraterrestrial habitability on Saturn's largest moon, Titan.
Key Features: Dragonfly is a rotorcraft that will fly to dozens of promising locations on Titan, Saturn's moon with a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid hydrocarbons. It will analyze Titan's organic-rich surface to understand its potential for life's building blocks.
