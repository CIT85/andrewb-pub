      <h2>About Exoplanets</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp;An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system. Since the
        first
        confirmed detection in the 1990s, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered using various methods, including
        the
        transit method (detecting a planet as it passes in front of its host star, causing a temporary dimming), radial
        velocity
        method (measuring the star's wobble caused by the planet's gravitational pull), and direct imaging.

        &emsp;These exoplanets represent a small fraction of the diverse and fascinating worlds discovered beyond our
        solar
        system,
        each offering unique insights into the variety of planetary systems in our galaxy.

          <h3>Kepler-186f:</h3>
          <p>
            Characteristics: Located about 500 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus, Kepler-186f is notable as
            the
            first
            Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of its star. This means it could have conditions
            suitable
            for
            liquid water, a key ingredient for life as we know it.

          <h3>TRAPPIST-1e:</h3>
          <p>
            Characteristics: Part of the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is just 40 light-years away, TRAPPIST-1e is one of
            seven
            Earth-sized planets orbiting an ultracool dwarf star. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone. The
            potential
            for liquid water and the proximity of the system make it a fascinating target for further study.

          <h3>HD 209458 b (Osiris):</h3>
          <p>
            Characteristics: This exoplanet, located about 150 light-years away, gained attention for being one of the
            first
            planets
            to have its atmosphere directly detected. Osiris is a hot Jupiter, orbiting very close to its host star. Its
            atmosphere
            contains elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon.

          <h3>WASP-121b:</h3>
          <p>
            Characteristics: WASP-121b is an exoplanet about 880 light-years away, known for its extreme conditions. It
            is a
            "hot
            Jupiter" with a surface temperature that reaches over 4,000 degrees Celsius (7,232 degrees Fahrenheit). The
            intense heat
            causes heavy metals like iron and magnesium to exist in a gaseous state in its atmosphere.

          <h3>OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb:</h3>
          <p>
            Characteristics: This exoplanet, discovered through gravitational microlensing, is located about 13,000
            light-years
            away. It is intriguing because it is a gas giant roughly four times the mass of Jupiter, orbiting a star at
            an
            enormous
            distance. Its discovery challenges conventional theories about where and how gas giants form.
