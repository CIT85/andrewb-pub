        <h2>Why:</h2>
        <p>&emsp;I have always been interested in space.
          Each planet and moon in our own Solar system is unique with many interesting aspects. Beyond our suns system
          are
          even
          more stars many with worlds which are just as unique as our own. In an ever expanding universe littered with
          countless
          galaxies, each filled with billions of stars, we can't be the only life that exists.</p>
