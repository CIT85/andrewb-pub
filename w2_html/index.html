        <h3>Why Learning HTML is a Good Idea:</h3>
        <p>
            I started writing code in 1994 with HTML4. I designed and managed Web Sites as a way to make some extra
            cash like some teenagers do babysitting or yardwork. One Site I managed was a local go-cart racing
            venue. I also designed the basic layout for Fresno State's Sigma Nursing Mu Nu Chapter website back
            then... its a lot different now, but I made a good $400 for that layout. It was basically a table with a
            cell to the left as a sitemap, that loaded the sites pages to a cell to the right as the main body.
            Stylesheets were barely a thing at that time and I didnt even try using them for a couple of years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took a break from HTML, and started hacking games mostly using Hexidecimals for games like Diablo and
            attempting to make mods.
        </p>
        <p>
            After Highschool I went into Computer Science for programming, at Fresno City College and took some
            courses at Devry for Game Design. At this point I know about six or more computer languages, and can
            read or debug almost anything put in front of me given the internet to do some research and enough time.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Couple years ago I decided that I probably wasn't going to make a career in games, so I signed up with
            Lambda School for their Full-Stack Web Design Program. It changed its name to Bloom Institute of
            Technology or BloomTech, around that time. Due to health reasons I couldn't keep up with their course
            work so was dropped. I do reccommend their bootcamp. it is very detailed and centered around how to sell
            yourself to get a job. I am considering trying it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment I am trying to get my AS degree in Web Design through Fresno City because I believe
            getting
            this degree will make me more desirable for a position in Web Design. Or at least be able to do
            Freelance work from home. I am at a position in my life where I need to really start a professional
            career, and I can't imagine really being able to do anything else.
