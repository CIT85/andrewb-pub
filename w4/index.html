            <h3>Why Learning HTML is a Good Idea:</h3>
            <p>
                I started writing code in 1994 with HTML4. I designed and managed Web Sites as a way to make some extra
                cash like some teenagers do babysitting or yardwork. One Site I managed was a local go-cart racing
                venue. I also designed the basic layout for Fresno State's Sigma Nursing Mu Nu Chapter website back
                then... its a lot different now, but I made a good $400 for that layout. It was basically a table with a
                cell to the left as a sitemap, that loaded the sites pages to a cell to the right as the main body.
                Stylesheets were barely a thing at that time and I didnt even try using them for a couple of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a break from HTML, and started hacking games mostly using Hexidecimals for games like Diablo and
                attempting to make mods.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Highschool I went into Computer Science for programming, at Fresno City College and took some
                courses at Devry for Game Design. At this point I know about six or more computer languages, and can
                read or debug almost anything put in front of me given the internet to do some research and enough time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Couple years ago I decided that I probably wasn't going to make a career in games, so I signed up with
                Lambda School for their Full-Stack Web Design Program. It changed its name to Bloom Institute of
                Technology or BloomTech, around that time. Due to health reasons I couldn't keep up with their course
                work so was dropped. I do reccommend their bootcamp. it is very detailed and centered around how to sell
                yourself to get a job. I am considering trying it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the moment I am trying to get my AS degree in Web Design through Fresno City because I believe
                getting
                this degree will make me more desirable for a position in Web Design. Or at least be able to do
                Freelance work from home. I am at a position in my life where I need to really start a professional
                career, and I can't imagine really being able to do anything else.
